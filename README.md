Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations. As a crucial part of the success of its custom software, the company also wants to use the latest and most effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). The company is seeking Global Rainâ€™s expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats.

I thnk when I found the clients security vunerabillities I brainstormed a decent plan for us to execute together so we can make sure they have a safe enviroment for their clientele. Coding securely is impportant because the client is looking for some type of buissness, and to drum up buissiness the end user must trust that what ever application oyu are making is secure so their information is poretetected. So, in turn if you code something securely you will get the buissiness from a client so their buissness wil take off as well.

Based on my grade I would say the mitigation plan was where I "struggled". In the rubric it was stated that I only generally stated how to mitigaste them so I would say I shouldve took more time to go into detail on the mitigation strategies.

The main thing I suggested to do to increase security is to update to the latest version of everything because it was all outdated. When stuf is outdated it makes it easier for hackers to crack the code to gain access. One other thing was there is no input validation method so I would have addded that as well. The dependency check seems to work well so I would stick with doing that to find vunerabilities. 

I would have updated everyhting to the latest version, added a input validation and added an error handling method. Then, I would run a dependecny check again to  check for new vunerabillities. 

The dependecny check is really helpful so I will use that in the future to make sure code is secure.

I will show how I ran a vunerabillity assessment and a dependecny check, then show them my plan to make the code more secure after they see the results.
